      <p>Do you know Rick and Morty? If not, start watching it!</p>
      <p>
        Anyways, the Rick and Morty universe is kinda big with a lot of
        characters and locations. You with your friends decided that you want to
        make it easier to look up information about each character and location.
        You want to create a React app that with the use of an open-source API,
        shows information about everything you need. Your friend built the tools
        for the data fetching, you just need to use the data and build the app.
